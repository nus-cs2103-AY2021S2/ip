JAMES CODE WEEK 2:
DRY

return (isDone ? "[X]" : "[ ]"); 

WEEK 3 NOTES:

Junit tests should only have one test per method
[csharp]WhatAreWeTesting_InWhatConditions_WhatAreExpectedResult[/csharp]
E.g. LogIn_ExistingUsernameWithIncorrectPassword_ShouldReturnMessageWrongPassword.
JUNIT tests should be for public methods which are "contracts"
Tests should be done in isolation. IE find a way to test only ONE method and ONE class. Use stubs
