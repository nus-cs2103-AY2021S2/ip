### Setup
While the simplest way to work with Steve is to download the latest jar release, the following section will guide you through setting up Steve as a project on IntelliJ for the more adventurous!
* First, cd to the directory of where you wish to store the project and clone this repository. An example is provided below:
```
$ cd /home/user/exampleuser/projects/
$ git clone https://github.com/tjtanjin/ip.git
```
* Next, open Intellij and select the project directory. Configure the project to use **JDK 11** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).
* Finally, locate the `src/main/java/com/tjtanjin/steve/Launcher.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Launcher.main()`. If the setup is correct, you should see something like the below:
