# IP Project: Lihua

**Lihua** is a friendly **task management bot** residing in a **desktop application**.
The bot is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefit of
a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Lihua can get your daily task management job done
faster than traditional GUI apps.
