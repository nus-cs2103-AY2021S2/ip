Butler Alfred is a desktop task management app that is optimised to be used via a Command Line Interface (CLI). It is suitable for people who are familiar with CLI and particularly benefits users who are able to type fast.

Thus, Butler Alfred can track and manage your tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.
