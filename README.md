### Categorise Tasks
There are 3 types of tasks in Apollo. Namely:

   > [T][ ] Read a book
2) Deadlines
   > [D][ ] Submit final year project (by: 03 Mar 2021)
3) Events

### Search for Tasks
You can easily find tasks by searching with matching keywords.

### Saving of Tasks
Tasks are saved automatically whenever you say "bye" to Apollo.
The saved data (/data/ApolloTaskData.txt) is saved in the same
folder as your Java executable. If no previous saves were found,
a new file would be created for you automatically.
