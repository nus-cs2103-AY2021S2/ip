# Chat the Cat: User Guide

Chat is a desktop app for managing your tasks. 
It is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI),
while having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## Features

### 1. Adding a new task

Adds a task to Chat's list of tasks. Type of task needs to be specified.

#### To add todo task: `todo`
* Command:`todo [name of todo task]`
* Example: `todo read book`

#### To add deadline task: `deadline`
* Command: `deadline [name of deadline task] /by [date]`
    * Date should be written as: **dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm**
