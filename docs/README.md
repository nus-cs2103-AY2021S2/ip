## Notes

**Notes about the command format:**

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
  e.g in `todo TASK_DESCRIPTION`, `TASK_DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used to describe the todo task.
  
* Items in square brackets are optional.
  e.g `event TASK_DESCRIPTION /at TASK_DATE [TASK_TIME]` can be used as `event TASK_DESCRIPTION /at TASK_DATE` OR `event TASK_DESCRIPTION /at TASK_DATE TASK_TIME`
 
 * Parameters order must be fixed.
 
 * If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, the chat bot will display an incorrect input.
   e.g `delete 1 2`
 
 * Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list` and `bye`) will result in chat bot returning a incorrect input message.
   e.g `list 123`
