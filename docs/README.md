**Notes about the command format:**

Commands are presented in the format: `command ARGS`

- `command` cases do not matter (both lowercase and uppercase works fine)
- Words in `[brackets]` are optional and may not be required
- Words with a `bar|seperating` indicate one of the option should be used and only one is needed
- Words in `UPPERCASE` are arguments to be supplied by the user
- For tasks recorded with Duke:
    - *todo* is represented as `[T][ ]`
    - *deadline* is represented as `[D][ ]`
    - *event* is represented as `[E][ ]`
    - where the `[ ] ` square bracket indicates the finished status of the particular task.

list

Here are the tasks in your list:
1. [T][ ] submit ip jar
2. [D][ ] submit ip jar (by: 19-2-2021)
3. [E][ ] team meeting (at: 2:00pm)

### <a name="done">`done` - Marking a task as done</a>

Marks a specific task as done using the index of the task.

Format: `done INDEX`
```
done 1

Nice! I've marked this task as done: 
[T][X] submit ip jar
```
### <a name="tag">`tag` - Tagging a task</a>
Creates a tag and associate the tag with the task

- only "1 word" tag is allowed at once, e.g. `tag 1 two worded tag` does not work

Format: `tag INDEX TAG`
```
tag 1 java

Nice! I've marked task 1 with the tag: #java
```

### <a name="find">`find` - Finding a task by name or tag</a>
Finds a task which contains the given word in the name or associate with the tag

(Find by tag requires exact tag name, and cannot find by tag and task name at the same time 
i.e. the item `[T][] submit ip jar #assignment` 
would require `find #assignment` but `find #assign` or `find smth #assign` won't work)

Format: `find KEYWORD|#TAG`
```
find #java

Here are the tasks in your list that fulfils your requirement:
1. [T][ ] submit ip jar
```

Deletes the specific task using its index

Format: `delete INDEX`

Noted. I've removed this task:

Now you have 2 tasks in your list
```
