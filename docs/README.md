3. Copy the file you downloaded in step 2 to the folder you want to use as the *home folder* for Lihua. 
   E.g. `~/Desktop/Lihua/Lihua.jar`

   Some example commands you can try:
   * `list`: Lists all tasks.
   * `todo Do CS2103T IP tasks.`: Adds a `todo` task named "Do CS2103T IP tasks.".
   * `done 1`: Marks the first task in your list as done.
   * `delete 1`: Deletes the first task in your list.
   * `bye`: Exits the application.
7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

Notes about the features:
- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
  e.g. in `todo TASKNAME`, `TASKNAME` is a parameter which can be used as `todo Do homework`.
- Items in square brackets are optional.
  e.g. `list [-time]` can be used as `list` or as `list -time`.
- Command keywords do not distinguish lower case and upper case.
  e.g. `list` is equivalent to `LiSt`.
- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters 
  (such as `help` and `exit`) will be ignored.
- Tasks will be stored based on their alphabetic order in the list, from the smallest to the largest. 

### Viewing Help

Format: `help`.

### Adding a task
Adds a task to the Lihua's task list. 
More specifically, there are 3 types of tasks you can add, as specified below.

#### Adding a todo
Adds a `todo` task to Lihua. A `todo` task is a task with only a task name.

Format: `todo TASKNAME`.

Example: `todo Do homework`.

#### Adding a deadline
Adds a `deadline` task to Lihua. A `deadline` task is a task with a task name and a task deadline date.

Format: `deadline TASKNAME /by YYYY-MM-DD`.

Example: `deadline Submit IP /by 2021-02-19`.

Notes:
- The date format must be `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- The indicator ` /by ` cannot be omitted nor replaced.

#### Adding an event
Adds an `event` task to Lihua. An `event` task is a task with a task name and a task commencement date.

Format: `event TASKNAME /at YYYY-MM-DD`.

Example: `event Party for PGPR /at 2020-02-23`.

Notes:
- The date format must be `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- The indicator ` /at ` cannot be omitted nor replaced.

### Listing tasks
Lists all tasks stored in Lihua.

Format: `list [-time]`.

Example:

![Ui-list](./images/Ui-list.png)

Notes:
- If `-time` is not applied, Lihua will list all current tasks in alphabetic order of task names.
- If `-time` is applied, Lihua will list all current tasks with date information in chronological order.
If two tasks are on the same date, then the relative ordering of the tasks will not change, 
  which is specified in the whole task list.

### Finding tasks by key word
Finds all tasks containing the key word specified.

Format: `find KEYWORDS`.

Example: `find abc`.

![Ui-find](./images/Ui-find.png)

Notes:
- Only one keyword is allowed. Extra parameters will be ignored.
e.g. `find abc a`, `a` will be ignored here.
- The search is not case-sensitive.
e.g. `find A` is equivalent to `find a`.
- The key word only needs to be part of the task name. It does not need to be the whole task name.
e.g. `find a` can return you a `todo` task named `abc`.

### Marking a task as done
Marks a task as done.

Format: `done TASKINDEX`.

Example: `done 1`.

Notes:
- The `TASKINDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list by calling `list`.
- The `TASKINDEX` you can specify is **an integer from 1 to total number tasks, inclusive**. 

### Deleting a task
Deletes a task.

Format: `delete TASKINDEX`.

Example: `delete 1`.

Notes:
- The `TASKINDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list by calling `list`.

### Saving the data
Lihua's data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. 
There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.
