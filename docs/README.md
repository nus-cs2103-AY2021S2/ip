# User Guide
The Duke program is a task management program that can help you schedule management such as **adding, deleting** events, deadlines and todos.
It is also optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Duke can help you manage tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.
## Features 

### Viewing help: `help` 
Shows a command guide.

Type in: `help`

### Adding a task: `todo`, `event`, `deadline`
Adds a task to the address book.

Command part 1:`{taskType} {taskName}`

Command part 2:`/by {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}` or `/at {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}`

Command part 3:`-p {levelOfPriority}`

Type in: `{Command part 1} {Command part 2} {Command part 3}` in correct order.

For example:

`todo go to school -p 3`; `deadline HW2 /at 2021-01-01 19:00 -p 5`; `todo watch movie`

Tips:

* `taskType` can only be `todo`, `event`, `deadline`.
* For `todo` type of task, there is no need to specify Command part 2.
* For `deadline`, use `/by`. For `event`, use `/at` when specifying Command part 2.
* Command part 3 can be ignored. If ignored, the default level of priority is 1.
* New added task will be regarded as undone.


### Listing all tasks : `list`

Tips:

`list` will list all the tasks. `list -p` will list all the tasks sorted by priority.
