# Features

Below are some commands that I understand. Commands are not case-sensitive, so I understand 'help', 'Help' and 'HELP'.
We squirrels are smart creatures!

## Command Format

Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user.
`(Round Brackets)` are used to denote optional parameters.
`...` is used to denote that one or more parameters are accepted.

## Seeking Help

The help command helps you remember what each command does. Help is always a 'help' away!

### `help (COMMAND)` - get information about syntax

Typing `help` will display the commands that are available. Typing help followed by the name of the command will display
more info on how the command can be used.
(COMMAND) should be a valid command.
