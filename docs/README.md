# Duke User Guide

Duke is a desk application to help users keep track of tasks, and make notes. It functions using a GUI (Graphical User
Interface) to help those potential users be at ease while using Duke.

## Basic Info

Duke allows the user to key in three types of tasks: todo, deadlines and events. Todo tasks are those that you expect to
finish immediately, and so does not have an end date. Deadlines and Events are tasks that must have an end date, whereas
it is optional to add time.

Duke also allows the user to keep track of notes, which are separately stored compared to tasks. Notes are flexible in
that you can key in anything, search for them using keywords, and be able to delete them if you know their index.
