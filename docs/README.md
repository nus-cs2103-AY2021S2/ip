## Features
**Notes about the command format:**
- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.\
  e.g. in `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `todo exercise`.

- When `DATE` is used as a parameter, it must be specified in the YYYY-MM-DD format.\
e.g. in `event DESCRIPTION at DATE`, user can input date as `event fieldtrip at 2021-02-17`.
  
- Extraneous parameters for commands, parameters in wrong formats or missing will not be recognised.\
eg. `deadline by 03-02-2021`, `help 123` will not be registered.
